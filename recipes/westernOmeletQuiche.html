    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust</li>
      <li>1 cup diced ham</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>

      <li>1 red bell pepper, diced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>

      <li>Place pie crust in a 9-inch glass pie plate. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir ham in a large skillet over medium heat until it no longer

        temperature.

      <li>
        Mix together cheese, milk, eggs, bell pepper, onion, garlic, black

        browned, and filling is set, about 1 hour.
